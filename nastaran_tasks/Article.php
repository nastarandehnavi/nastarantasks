I am Nastaran Dehnavi and I am studying at HAMK University in Hämeenlinna. I read an article about Damavand Peak, and now I will share the article with you.

Damavand Peak is located in the central part of the Alborz mountain range, south of the Caspian Sea, and in the Larijaan section of Amel city. Damavand Peak is the highest volcanic peak on the Asian continent and the highest peak in the mountains of Iran and the Middle East. It has a height of 5,000 meters, which causes the temperature on Damavand Peak to reach zero degrees in summers and 60 degrees below zero in winters
